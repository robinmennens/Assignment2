V   Show number of occurrences in grid
-(M) In the grid, when hovering over a rectangle, the row and column it is located in light up a bit (until the point where the rectangle is located)
-(M) Link the grid to the graph, clicking on a name also selects the node in the graph and clicking on a rectangle also lights up the edge in the graph, and vice versa
-(R) Make a "Focussed Graph" part which only shows a small part of the network including labels, etc.


Spotted problems:
- There is no legend for the colors (mainly important for the frequency coloring)
- When selecting a node in the graph, the corresponding row and column in the matrix are lit up. However we could also do something with corresponding text in the matrix.
- When hovering over one of the diagonal cells in the matrix this calls a "OnNodeClick" however this is often not what was intended (so probably just remove this)
- Our node selection should probably be more visible. When clicking a node in the graph or a name in the matrix a node is selected. In the graph this is nicely represented by a bigger node, however in the matrix there is not really a visual indication of which node is selected. Considerations: keep the corresponding row and column highlighted for the selected "person". 
- I like making the nodes in the graph bigger, but now they are maybe a bit toooo big :P. Consideration: Make the nodes bigger but not too much, and then also highlight the edge a bit more by making it wider and black and possibly also show the count (problem that could occur here is that the edge is drawn below other edges).
-The function in the previous point does not seem to work always. For example focussing on Valjean and then hovering over the connections in the matrix between Valjean and some other person does not always enlarge two endpoints. I think that this happens because you "toggle" the endpoint size. So if you select a connection including Valjean then it is fine, however if you directly after that select another connection with Valjean then Valjean is "toggled" again making the node small again.
-Showing count values in the focus graph will probably make it really cluttered. An option would be to enlarge the nodes and put a count value inside the node itself. However this would still not show the count values of the edges.
